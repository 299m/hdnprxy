Currently this is WIP. Feel free to try it - but it's not been tested or anything.

## Tunnels

Tunnels are designed to act as a HTTPS proxy. Confiugre your browser to use the tunnel as a proxy and it will forward all requests to the external proxy server
through a tunnel. This allows you to have a local proxy.

If you simply point your browser at the tunnel though, it won't work, as only the first request will get proxied.
